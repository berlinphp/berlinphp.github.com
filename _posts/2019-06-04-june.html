                      Everybody was Git Fu developing, those bugs came fast as lightning.
                      In fact it was a little bit frightening, but they fought with expert rebasing.
                      There were funky Developers from funky everywhere.
                      They were merging bend up, they where merging bend down.
                      It is a special developer art, and everybody knew their part.
                      For my friend, ain’t your head is detached. Then im guiding you to a clean state.
                      Everybody was Git Fu developing, those problems where solved fast as lightning.
