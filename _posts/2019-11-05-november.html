                  <h4>Understanding Git</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>Git is a standard tool for version control these days so we all use it daily. And we all understand it. Or do we?</p>

                   <p>Let's face it - git is hard. And one of the main reasons for this is that it's UI is full of leaky abstractions. That is why to get comfortable with git one must gain some understanding of how git works "under the hood". So in this talk, we're gonna do exactly that and see how gits data model works, how git handles branching and what staging area really is.</p>
