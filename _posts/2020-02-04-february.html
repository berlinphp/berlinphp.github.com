                  <h4>Exploring Async PHP</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>As PHP programmers we are used to waiting for network I/O, in general we may not even consider any other option. But why wait? Why not jump on board the Async bullet-train and experience life in the fast lane and give Go and NodeJS a run for the money. This talk will aim to make the audience aware of the benefits, opportunities, and pitfalls of asynchronous programming in PHP, and guide them through the native functionality, frameworks and PHP extensions though which it can be facilitated.</p>

    {% comment %} TITLE OF YOUR TALK:                         {% endcomment %}
                  <h4>Containers as VMs</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>
                      I've been exploring <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/footloose"></a>WeaveWorks' footloose</a> ("Containers which look like VMs") for local development and CI.
                      My talk is most likely going to be a (hopefully bug-free) live-demo of how I installed and use footloose.
                      And if this works too well, then we can look at footloose' integration with Ignite (AWS FireCracker).
                  </p>
