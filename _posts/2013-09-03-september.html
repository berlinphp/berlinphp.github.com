                  <h4>The QB extension: Performing computationally intensive tasks in PHP</h4>

    {% comment %} SUB-TITLE OR DESCRIPTION:                   {% endcomment %}
                  <p>While PHP is an excellent language for building complex web application, it imposes certain limitations. Writing code that performs low-level, computationally intensive tasks in PHP is generally impractical--it'd simply be too slow. The QB extension addresses this particular weakness of PHP. By translating Zend opcodes and executing them through a statically typed virtual machine, QB offers an order-of-magnitude gain in performance. The added power allows PHP programmers do things they were unable to do before, such as complex pixel-level image manipulation.</p>
